# kcFED Code-A-Thon 2018
Project Description:

Working within the theme of "Don't Make Me Think", our team has developed a program with the intent of providing the most frictionless and responsive experience for the end user as we can. Our project, Consolidate, is a website intended to be saved as the user's homepage providing easy access to many of the utilities they require during regular web browsing in one place. Our program provides a centralized hub for the user utilizing publicly available widgets that access specific APIs to perform various tasks. Users are provided with customizable tiles that can be easily added/deleted, resized, and moved with simple, intuitive commands. The design of our interface reflects a minimalist approach that is meant to produce a homepage that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional.

Future Directions:

Consolidate is very much a work in progress. Moving forward with this project, there are many features we would like to add and tweaks we would like to make. First and foremost, we would like to develop our own widgets instead of the open-source applications our program currently utilizes. This would include creating new and inventive widgets with available APIs. For those utilities that do not yet have a widget, we would like to expand the “Paste URL to Add Window” system to work with all websites. As of now, the webpage does not save user preferences between sessions. Obviously, this is something we would like to change in the future: possibly by implementing a login system. There are some design elements that we would also like to improve upon, mainly in the realm of adding dynamic transitions to moving elements such as the menu tab. We also want the user to be able to further customize their experience with a greater array of widget sizes and color editing. The integrated search bar at the top of the page only searches google by default; we would like to make it so that the user can choose from several options of search engines.
